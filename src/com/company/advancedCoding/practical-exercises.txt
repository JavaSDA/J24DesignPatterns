Create a class called Calculator, and create methods in the calculator class for addition,
subtraction, division, and multiplication. Implement these methods, using exceptions to
handle Arithmetic related errors (e.g Division by zero) Use functional programming to
implement the actual method operations.

Create a class called Book with the properties:
- title
- author
- price

Create a second class called BookCatalogue to manage a collection of Book objects.
Implement the following behaviours in the BookCatalogue class.
- Add a book to the catalogue
- Remove a book from the catalogue
- Search for a book by author
- Search for a book by title
- Get the total price of all the books available in the catalogue

Use lambda expressions and streams to implement the respective search methods
by title and by author.

Create a class called TemperatureConverter and that has methods for methods
to convert temperature between Celsius and Fahrenheit, Use exceptions to
return errors when values that are outside the range are entered.

For celsius, the absolute zero value is -273C, if someone enters a value lower than this
it should throw an exception such as an IllegalArgumentException. The equivalent for fahrenheit
is -459F.

Use FP to implement the respective conversion methods for both the fahrenheit and celsius
conversions.

For context, the methods can be named as thus:
- convertToCelsius(double fahrenheit)
- convertToFahrenheit(double celsius)

Formulas:
- convertToCelsius = (fah - 32) / 1.8
- convertToFahrenheit = (cel * 1.8) + 32

Create a class called GuessTheNumber that will represent the game.
In the class, you're expected to have a method that will generate
a random number between and including 1 - 100 using the Random class.


Create a menu as part of the program and this program should have
a welcome message and prompt the user for their name.

The number attempts each user can guess a number is 10 times.
For each guess, you are expected to return a prompt telling the user
if the number entered is higher or lower than the actual number to be guessed.

Keep track of the attempts and display the number of attempts left after each guess.

If a player guess the number correctly, write an appropriate message for them, else
if they exhaust their guesses,then tell them it's 'game over' then display the correct number

Bonus: There should be an option to exit and/or restart the game.
