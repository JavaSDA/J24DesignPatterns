Create a class called Calculator, and create methods in the calculator class for addition,
subtraction, division, and multiplication. Implement these methods, using exceptions to
handle Arithmetic related errors (e.g Division by zero) Use functional programming to
implement the actual method operations.












40 mins.
Create a class called Book with the properties:
- title
- author
- price

Create a second class called BookCatalogue to manage a collection of Book objects.
Implement the following behaviours in the BookCatalogue class.
- Add a book to the catalogue
- Remove a book from the catalogue
- Search for a book by author
- Search for a book by title
- Get the total price of all the books available in the catalogue

Use lambda expressions and streams to implement the respective search methods
by title and by author.

Create a class called TemperatureConverter and that has methods for methods
to convert temperature between Celsius and Fahrenheit, Use exceptions to
return errors when values that are outside the range are entered.

For celsius, the absolute zero value is -273C, if someone enters a value lower than this
it should throw an exception such as an IllegalArgumentException. The equivalent for fahrenheit
is -459F.

Use FP to implement the respective conversion methods for both the fahrenheit and celsius
conversions.

For context, the methods can be named as thus:
- convertToCelsius(double fahrenheit)
- convertToFahrenheit(double celsius)

Formulas:
- convertToCelsius = (fah - 32) / 1.8
- convertToFahrenheit = (cel * 1.8) + 32

Create a class called GuessTheNumber that will represent the game.
In the class, you're expected to have a method that will generate
a random number between and including 1 - 100 using the Random class.


Create a menu as part of the program and this program should have
a welcome message and prompt the user for their name.

The number attempts each user can guess a number is 10 times.
For each guess, you are expected to return a prompt telling the user
if the number entered is higher or lower than the actual number to be guessed.

Keep track of the attempts and display the number of attempts left after each guess.

If a player guess the number correctly, write an appropriate message for them, else
if they exhaust their guesses,then tell them it's 'game over' then display the correct number

Bonus: There should be an option to exit and/or restart the game.

Create a class called Product and give it the following properties:
- productId
- productName
- price


Create a class called ShoppingCart and give the following features:
- add product
- remove products
- display products in the cart.
- calculate the total price of items in the shopping cart.
- BONUS: clear the cart


40 mins
Continuation:
Add a property called quantity to the Product class.

Create a separate class called Inventory and implement the following behaviours using streams
- Return a list of products whose price is less than a given value
- Return a list of products whose quantity is greater than or equal to 10
- Return the total sum of the prices of all the products in the inventory
- Return the average price of all the products in the inventory
- Return the most expensive product in the inventory








Create a class called Employee with the following properties:
- firstName
- lastName
- salary
- age

Create a class called Company that holds a collection of employee objects.
In the company class, implement the following behaviour, WITHOUT using streams.
- getAverageSalary()
- getOldestEmployee()
- getRandomEmployee()

For the getRandomEmployee(), Assume that you were given a task to create
a roster for employees that will decide who will work the
night shift based on a random basis. The method should return a random employee
whenever it is called








Write a program that generates a random password of a given length.
The password should contain a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters and digits.
Use a StringBuilder to build the password and a Random object to generate the
characters. Use the scanner to make the program interactive.

======================================================================
What's the expected length of the password?: 10

Write a program that calculates the sum of the squares of
the first 20 positive integers. (1-20), use a lambda expression
to map each integer and then accumulate or sum the resulting stream
of integers to a single value using the reduce() method

Write a program that reads a list of words from the console and prints
out the longest word. Use a lambda expression to find the length of the words.
