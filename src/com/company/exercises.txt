Create a singleton called Students. This singleton will
store a list of students names as strings then implement the
following functionality

When adding a student to the list:
- We should have a method to add a student
and it should return a boolean based on the success
of that addition (If it gets added successfully,
returns true, else it returns false)
- In order to successfully add a student the name must
be prefixed by/with either 'senior' or 'junior'
e.x junior Dwayne Johnson
- Adding a duplicate name is not allowed.
- Add a method to retrieve all students with a prefix of
'senior'
- Add a method to retreive all students with a prefix of 'junior'
