Singleton is a creational design pattern for creating an object
that can be constructed at most once, during the application's lifetime.

Types of Singleton
Eager singleton - The instance for this singleton is created as the
application starts.
Lazy singleton - The instance for this singleton is created at the first
point where the instance is required afterwards, after that the same
instance will be used for the rest of the application's lifetime.

Singleton Implementations
Eager singleton implementation
- Class-based implementation
- Enum-based implementation
N.B: All implementations of the eager singletons are thread-safe.

Lazy singleton Implementations
- Lazy singleton (not thread safe)
- Lazy double-checked singleton(thread-safe)
